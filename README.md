# BPD_Dispatch_Analysis
Using web scraping to analyze the Burlington Police Department Dispatch Logs 
This project started as an idea to calculate the average daily overdose calls in Burlington in order to analyze spikes and dips in activity, providing valuable
information for city officials in policy making

Eventually I'd like this project to evolve into a program that can be used by various departments to analyze how often any type of dispatch is performed, but to begin
I will only be analyzing BPD overdose calls.
